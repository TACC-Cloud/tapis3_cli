Tapis3 CLI is a human-friendly, scriptable command line interface, implemented in
Python 3, that helps scientists and engineers build and manage scalable computational
and data science workflow projects using the Tapis_ platform.

Tapis3 CLI provides a unified interface to multiple web service APIs, allowing them
to be easily orchestrated and composed into higher-order constructs combining
HPC, data management, cloud computing, and other aspects of computing.
